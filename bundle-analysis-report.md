## Bundle Size Analysis

| Package | Version | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| react-native | 0.79.5 | 71.36 MB |
| expo | 53.0.22 | 506.58 KB |
| @expo/vector-icons | ^14.1.0 | 5.49 MB |
| @shopify/flash-list | 1.7.6 | 723.18 KB |
| react-native-reanimated | ~3.17.4 | 3.3 MB |
| react-native-gesture-handler | ~2.24.0 | 4.04 MB |

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Consider alternatives for large dependencies (medium priority)

**Description:** Large packages detected: react-native, @expo/vector-icons

**Action:** Review if these packages can be replaced with lighter alternatives

**Impact:** Significantly reduces bundle size

### 2. Enable platform-specific optimizations (medium priority)

**Description:** Use Platform.select() for platform-specific imports

**Action:** Review imports and use conditional loading where appropriate

**Impact:** Reduces platform-specific bundle sizes

### 3. Optimize imports for tree shaking (high priority)

**Description:** Use named imports instead of default imports where possible

**Action:** Replace import * as X from "package" with import { specific } from "package"

**Impact:** Eliminates unused code from bundles

### 4. Implement route-based code splitting (high priority)

**Description:** Split code by routes to reduce initial bundle size

**Action:** Use React.lazy() and dynamic imports for route components

**Impact:** Faster initial load times


## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Web
- Enable service worker for caching
- Use code splitting aggressively
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

### Mobile (iOS/Android)
- Be conservative with code splitting
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Monitor memory usage


## Next Steps

1. Review and remove unused dependencies
2. Implement recommended optimizations
3. Test bundle sizes after changes
4. Monitor performance metrics
5. Run this analysis regularly
